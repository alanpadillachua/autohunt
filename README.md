## Project Goal
In short autohunt will be a command line tool for SFS recipients, that compiles a list of possible cyber security jobs/internships. The list will be exported as a csv which the user can use as a guide for filling out applications and they can mark which ones have been applied to. It will hunt for jobs/internships two ways: 

1. Use public APIs (for sites that have them) to submit queries to and filter jobs to the user needs. 
2. Have a built in web scrapper that targets sites to pick up Job Posting information (position, application link, day posted, closing date, etc)

### Job Sites Supported 

1. usajobs.gov
